# Insteon Terminal
The Insteon Terminal is a simple tool to send and receive messages on an Insteon network, using either a PLM modem or a Hub.

Look elsewhere if you want a polished interface to automate your home. The Insteon Terminal is meant as a raw developer tool for the purpose of exploring how a device responds to a message, and what messages a device emits.
You can do highly dangerous stuff like directly modifying a device's (or your modem's) link database. You have been warned.
